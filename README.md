# apama_life

This is a Game of Life written for use within an Apama correlator. It has a static start arrangement and environment size, configurable within the code.

It was written when I was first learning EPL, way back on Apama 4.2 or 4.3. It still works fine on Apama 10.3. It uses multiple contexts but was written before features such as channels became available.

The front end display uses the SL Dashboards which come with Apama.
